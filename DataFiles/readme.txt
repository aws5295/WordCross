This folder contains serialized Trees representing all words that start with a common letter.
Taking the letter 'T' for example:
T
|_A
  |_B*
  | |_B
  |   |_Y*
  |_L
    |_E*
    |_L*
      |_E
        |_R*
        |_S
          |_T*

A '*' indicates that that child node is a word.
So traversing this sample tree, we see the words represented are:
    TAB
    TABBY
    TALE
    TALL
    TALLER
    TALLEST

There can be one file for each Starting letter (Root Node) of the tree.
A-data.node.bin
B-data.node.bin
C-data.node.bin
